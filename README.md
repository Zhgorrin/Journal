# Daily Journal with Mood Tracker
Our app is designed to be as simple and intuitive as possible. 
It can be run in the same way you would any other flutter application, simply load the APK onto your phone and use it. 
Upon opening the app for the first time you will see a green button with the '+' symbol on it, press that button to create your first entry. 
Within the editor you can enter the text of your entry, select your mood, or add images via the image button at the top of the screen.
Press the floppy disk icon to save your entry, the date and time will be saved automatically. 
At this point you can create additional entries, or review prior ones. 
When reviewing prior entries you will also have the option to delete them via the red trash button.
